Posted this on Instagram a couple of days ago, the Apple faces longest sales drop in decades as iPhone sales slump. So Apple is confronting its largest sales decline in decades attributed to the slump in iPhone sales. These factors might be contributing to this downturn, including market saturation, intensified competition from other smartphone manufacturers and ongoing global supply chain issues. The iPhone has traditionally been significant source of revenue for Apple. And this decline might prompt a reassessment of the strategy or an exploration of new avenues for growth. The situation presents a notable development in the tech industry and stakeholders will be keen to observe how Apple navigates this challenging period. So we've also saw Apple stock decline last week. So you talk about Apple a lot as far as there's two stocks that everybody should have in your opinion and those stocks are Apple and Microsoft. But this is saying that Apple is facing challenges with its number one product, which is the iPhone. And we saw a stock drop a little bit last week. iPhone sales are slowing down. So should this be considered when people are thinking about investing in Apple for the next 10 years? Hell yeah, Apple. I'm on your ass today. I'm usually an Apple Avenger and Apple advocate and I still am. But I will say, and I think we all can agree, Apple needs extreme innovation in iPhone. I think one of the main reasons why people are not, I think the iPhone 15 comes out in September. I haven't heard one person on earth be like, I can't wait for the 15 to drop. These like the Jordan 29. I should say everybody Jordan, Michael Jordan, Jordan Brand, Marcus Jordan, Larsa, everybody. I don't think anyone is looking forward to it and even myself. Like when I lost my phone in the ocean, I'm like, well, maybe I should get a 14 regular or go get a Samsung. And for the first time, I'm like, maybe I should go get a Samsung. So I think they need some innovative features in their iPhone, at least 15 features. Because for the last, let's say what 12 years, Samsung has innovated and created some amazing features and benefits for the phone and Apple will copy them four or five years later. Secondly, I think they need another Johnny Ive. They need a person that can create an amazing product that looks well, that's super innovative. Third, I think they need to make an aggressive push into healthcare, either with a partnership with Eli Lilly or acquiring a smaller player because they need to start the hedge just in case that they lose that edge in the tech space. And I think because Tim is a great operator, he's not an innovator per se, but he's innovative in how he's done operations. I think Apple's got very comfortable. I'm not going to lie. Do I still think it's the greatest publicly traded stock of all time? Yes. A lot of the drop of last week was because of the credit rating and they were at the top. They hit an all time high, I think two or three weeks ago. So they were bound to come down. But Apple has for too long has been lagging in their innovation and they weren't, you're not really looking, I think they should have bought DJI a long time ago as well on the camera side for everyone who's making content, but you need more disruptive innovation there in their product line. It's just not there. I feel like the last five iPhones and iPads have been generally the same. Businesses have done incredibly well, but if the product isn't amazing, the services business is going to fall apart. For all of my entrepreneurs, like if you have an amazing design product innovation, I was reading they could have bought mid journey a couple of years ago and the parameters didn't work out well. That would have been a nice product for them to have in their suite to put into the iPhone. So put it there. But I just think they need some drastic innovation and they're not exposed too well to the enterprise side. So if I'm looking at it from a contrarian view of what they need to improve, those are the four or five things that they need to fix in order to be a better brand going forward to make me hold on for the next 10 years. Yeah. I think you made a great point about they got comfortable because when they got comfortable, the customer got comfortable. I know the shy, you just mentioned a couple of things from competitors, but across the board, smartphone sales are down. Yeah. So I'm not sure if that's the biggest issue. We talk about the supply chain. We watched TSM go down. We saw AMD pull back a little bit. We saw Qualcomm pull back and the reason was it wasn't because of the supply, the demand, it was that they had too much. They had too much and the demand has slowed down. And so that comfortability has led people to be comfortable as well. The person that has the iPhone 13 is not complaining that they need the 14. Nope. They're not going to be complaining that they need the 15 either, because like you said, there is no disruptive innovation. And now when I looked at the preview for the new one, it's like, all right, this is cool. But my 14 does just the same thing. And so like that disruption is not there, which is an issue, but we can't like take out the fact that inflation has played a part in it. Because if I have to decide between getting a need or paying $1,500 for a cell phone, you're going to go with the need first. Right? It's not a discretionary spend anymore. And so that plays a part in it as well. But like you said, there are some upsides, right? If we look at the company, yeah, it pulled back, but it's still up 40% for the year. Yeah. We can't ignore that. You talked about the service side. That's up 21 billion. They make 21 billion just in services. And so that plays a part into it. And then we're looking at expansion. And so there was growth outside of just the United States. The cell phone market has gone down for them in the United States, but it's 4% in China. It's gone up 4%. They've gone into India. They've gone into Indonesia. So it's kind of what we were saying for the past month. It's like, yeah, they haven't had the innovative product. And so the new product is like, let's go take over more markets. And it's a slow process, but it seems to be a thing until the Vision Pro. The other thing with the Vision Pro is the price point. Price point, yeah. Right? So if you got a $1,500 phone and now you have a new innovative piece of equipment that's going to cost $3,500. And when we're talking about the times that we're in, especially when we're quote unquote recessionary times, you have to take that into account. How many people can now afford that? You will have a population that will, but how many people will look at it and how they actually need to have. So you got to take these things into account when you see Apple pull back like that. Yeah. I mean, the last thing I'll say, am I down on the company long-term? No. No. Apple, I mean, I made $38 million an hour this quarter. So Apple is printing more money in a month than some companies will do in six months. So I still think it's incredibly in rare air, but sales are down 1.4% year over year. And guided lower, Macs are down 7%. Even with the MacBook and MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, I think some of the desire to why cell phones are down, it's going back to a utility type of product where you felt before you were getting something new. You can't, especially in recession, you can't resell the same thing over and over again. Like even for me, and it's like 2.5 version of stock club, like there's 34 different things that I'm adding just because people need more bang for their buck. And Apple is like a luxury company. So when you have a luxury, yes, you can go take over more markets, but at some point the product just needs to be better. And we haven't had that innovation yet. And that's why I say, I think you need a Johnny Ive. There was a huge divide in Apple, the corporation between if it should be more efficient or if it should be more creative, like Steve was the more creative person. Tim was the more the operation. You need both. Like even when you guys see the rollouts for invest fast and market Mondays, and I know Joe Budden always criticized my little wrestling intros. You need both. I got tired of going to conferences on a Sunday and like, here's how to invest in the S&P and get three. No, you need both. So they need more innovation. The product needs to be better. I want to be able to zoom into a hundred X and see the moon like the Samsung can. Like we need to do more. So this is my outcry to Apple and everyone on their board is like, please find someone who can create better products at a faster rate so that the sales can improve and be stable as we go into this time. And the reason we talk about the iPhone sales, right? Specifically when we talk about Apple is because if you look at the revenue model, 50% of the revenue comes from the iPhone sales. Yep. Anytime there's a report that they've been declining like they have for the past three quarters is going to draw a lot of attention because it's a lot of revenue from the wealthiest company by market cap world. So we got to pay attention to that. Anything that starts to trend negative, like you said, is not beneficial. So they got to figure out what it's going to be. And for what I've seen from the 15, I don't know. I think, I think we, I mean, the fourth quarter is a strong quarter for them because of the fact that they released it at the end of September and now those sales, you know, go into the next quarter. So we'll see. I mean, I'm sure people, the brand loyalty will be strong. We'll just see how many people are interested in having the newest product and the price point for it. Yeah. Everyone put in chat, what three features would you like to see put in an iPhone that would make you want to buy it? Yeah. I think they said early next year, you know, we saw Google have their, their, uh, GBT product and we saw obviously Microsoft with their GBT product. I think by the first quarter of next year, that might be something that they're trying to have installed inside of the newest phones. And so that might be something that's innovative. Um, we already know what, you know, they had Siri, but this is, this is something, a product that they admittedly said that they've been working on for the past five to eight years. Yeah. So, you know, they, they, it's not like they behind the ball. They're just waiting for the opportunity time to put it out. So we'll see. Maybe that's something that sparks. I actually got this from a brand perspective. How long do you think you can get away by being a brand that drops features after your competition? It's worked thus far. I'm not worried about if it's worked thus far. I'm worried about if it can work for the next 10 years. Yes. And most we've seen legacy companies, IBM, PayPal, like some huge corporations that were dominant in a previous decade, the next decade, not be able to keep up. And then here comes Eli, regardless of the lack of efficiency, I think he may have, you can't argue about him trying to innovate. Yes. He's missed up, which rebranding Twitter and the accent, but he's trying though. He's not resting on his laurels though, like the team with the executives at PayPal. So my fear is like, can they keep this lead? And we'll talk about Amazon later. Cause like Amazon in a few years has a chance to be the highest grossing revenue company of all time. You can't lose that lead. And like I said, if Bezos get off that yacht with their Latina and his wife, hey, and come back and run shop. Cause in a recession Amazon, cause you're not just competing against those in your class, you're competing against every brand in the world. Amazon is a formidable opponent for Apple as an investor. If they get a celebrity CEO that is trusted and that pipeline continues to be full, AWS continues to be a monster. If they lose that number two slot and then we have Microsoft's right on their tail.

Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were introduced to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.\nApples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit frequently lacks desired characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting.\nThere are more than 7,500 cultivars of apples. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and uses, including cooking, eating raw, and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone to fungal, bacterial, and pest problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's genome was sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.\nWorldwide production of apples in 2021 was 93 million tonnes, with China accounting for nearly half of the total."}, "podcast_highlights": "- Highlight 1 of the podcast: \"Apple needs extreme innovation in iPhone.\"\n- Highlight 2 of the podcast: \"They need another Johnny Ive to create an amazing, innovative product.\"\n- Highlight 3 of the podcast: \"They need to make an aggressive push into healthcare.\"\n- Highlight 4 of the podcast: \"Apple has been lagging in innovation for too long.\"\n- Highlight 5 of the podcast: \"They need to fix their product line and improve enterprise exposure to be a better brand.\""}
